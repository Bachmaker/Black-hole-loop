               To develop the sense of hard-working in children, parents or teachers should tell
               them the stories of successful persons of a country. The children should choose
                a role model for their life so to focus on their own life. This will help them study hard with interest.

      <p id='text2'>We can work hard if we have the determination and focus in life.
        Concentration in work is very important. If one concentrates fully while doing work,
        the work gets finished successfully and very soon. We must work to increase our concentration level.
        Hard work is very much important to develop our concentration power.
